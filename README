Try not to crash that bird.

Controls:

    space  --  flap up
    p      --  (un)pause game
    ^C     --  abort game

Map generation:

    The walls are placed randomly. However, you can set the seed of the random
    number generator:

        Default level:

            $ ./birtty

        Level 7239:

            $ ./birtty 7239

    Thus, like in the good old DOS game "Worms", you can choose between a huge
    number of different maps.

Score:

    Your score increases by one with each wall you have passed. Try to maximize
    your score. Be aware, though, that birtty follows to spirit of many old
    games: It just gets harder and harder, until you lose.

Dependencies:

    A modern POSIX OS and a VT-ish terminal should be sufficient. birtty has
    been written on Arch Linux and tested on OpenBSD 5.7. Your terminal should
    be at least 80 characters wide and 50 characters high.


birtty was inspired by itsdogtime's "@y bird" [1], which, in turn, is a clone of
"Flappy Bird" [2].
